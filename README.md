Hey,
My names Chester, I'm 31 years old and I'm exploring software developer as a potential career change. I'm currently on in the very early stages of the Odin project and it's so far very interesting and ejoyable, I plan to keep going with it even if my plan A works out which is an apprenticeship in engineering
